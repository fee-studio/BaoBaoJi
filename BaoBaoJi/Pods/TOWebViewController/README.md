TOWebViewController is an open-source `UIViewController` subclass designed to fulfill one goal: to be able to quickly present a web page to the user, without needing to leave the current app. TOWebViewController has been designed from the ground up to be easily integrated into existing projects, and to optionally be backwards compatible with earlier versions of iOS.

## Features
* Backwards compatible down to iOS 5.
* Full navigation buttons set, including back, forward, refresh and an optional 'action' button.
* Detects whether being pushed modally via `[UIViewController presentViewController]` or being pushed onto a `UINavigationController` stack and adjusts the UI accordingly.
*  A page load progress bar  (using [ninjinkun's amazing algorithm](https://github.com/ninjinkun/NJKWebViewProgress) )
* Plays a smooth, elegant rotation animation if/when the user rotates the device
* Icons are procedurally generated by CoreGraphics (ie, no un-necessary iOS 6 icons if you're only targeting iOS 7)
* (TODO) Implement a confirmation dialog when the web view tries to switch to another app.
* (TODO) Re-implement the popup that appears when users tap and hold a link for added flexibility.  
* (TODO) An optional text field for which users may manually enter in a URL
* (TODO) A proper delegate system to allow external classes to interact with this controller.
* (TODO) A rudimentary bookmark system.
